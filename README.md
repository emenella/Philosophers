# Philosophers

This is a simple implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, which is a classic synchronization exercise in computer science. The project explores the challenge of coordinating multiple processes or threads that compete for shared resources.

## Problem Description

In this scenario, a group of philosophers is seated around a table, and they alternate between thinking and eating. There are plates of spaghetti and forks placed between each philosopher. However, each philosopher requires two forks to eat, and there are a limited number of forks available.

The goal is to develop a solution that allows each philosopher to eat without causing deadlocks or resource conflicts. You need to implement synchronization mechanisms to avoid situations where philosophers are unable to make progress due to competing for the same forks.

## Solution

In this implementation, a solution based on the concept of semaphore is used to manage the forks. Each philosopher is represented by a separate thread, and semaphores are used to control access to the forks. By enforcing certain rules and synchronization constraints, we ensure that the philosophers can eat without conflicts.
